## PyGol - Cellular Automaton

### Background
[Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) implementation using Pygame.

*from wikipedia:* "The game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves. It is Turing complete and can simulate a universal constructor or any other Turing machine."

The game is governed by three rules:
* Any live cell with two or three neighbors survives.
* Any dead cell with three live neighbors becomes a live cell.
* All other live cells die in the next generation. 

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites
  * Pygame
  * Python 3.x
  
#### Running The Game
clone the repo and navigate to its directory

run ```python3 conway.py ```

#### Controls
* **spacebar** - pauses/unpauses the game
* **f** - clears the board
* click and drag to add cells - easiest while the game is paused
